## Challenge Overview

The Apify $1M Challenge is designed to reward developers who build and publish high-quality automation tools, web scrapers, MCP servers, and AI agent tools on the Apify Store. Developers can earn both immediate challenge prizes and ongoing passive income from users who run their Actors.

**Key Opportunity:** AI is doing more work than ever, but the tools are still missing. This is your chance to build automation workflows, web data extractors, MCP servers, and new tools for AI agents to fill this gap.

**What is Apify Store?**
- Marketplace of 8,000+ AI and automation tools called "Actors"
- 25,000 customers actively using the platform
- In September alone, Apify paid out $563,000 to community developers
- Developers earn regular passive income from customers who use their Actors
